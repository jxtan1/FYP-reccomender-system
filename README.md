Objectives - 

"Final-year-project (FYP) is an essential part of the degree course that you have to complete. The objective of this project is to develop your ability to develop a reasonably complex software application system. The project will expose you to the real-life application development activities, and will develop your ability to handle the definition, design, programming and documentation of non-trivial software project.

This project aims to apply the collaborative filtering technique to predict the rating score a user might give to an item. This is the basis of a recommendation system that can be used to support eCommerce.

The project has the following tasks:
1. Data collection. The data will be collected by crawling as eCommerce website such as Lazada SG. The dataset includes various information for each product such as the itemID and review information (including customer name and rating core).
